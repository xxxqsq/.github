# gamerqueen's
public github org for the gamerqueen's restoreaunt chain.

pfp is made in [paint.NET](https://github.com/paintdotnet), drawn with a mouse in 114x108px, then resized to 1024x970 so it isn't as compressed by gh. (need to remake it in a vector format)

## why
why not?

no, but actually, it was mostly made to hold a username on github, with an added bonus of creating a fake IP to use in media, and a github organization for the usual corporate "we totally like open-source, not just open-sourcing stuff out of necessity" thing.
